# ProxyDupeRemover
This is a duplicates remover that runs quick and fast using threading.<br />
Simple to use just place proxies.txt in the same folder as the ProxyDupeRemover console application and run it.<br />
It will read the proxies.txt file (won't overwrite it) and will start to process it...<br />
You will get live updates in the console app as it's processing through the list and removing duplicates.<br />
After it's done removing duplicates in the same folder it will save a fixed copy as proxies-fixed.txt<br />
This was a quick hack n slash write up based on some example code that I had to use threading for because it's too slow without threading.
